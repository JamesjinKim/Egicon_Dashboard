Product Summary
The SPS30 Particulate Matter (PM) sensor is a technological breakthrough in optical PM sensors. Its
measurement principle is based on laser scattering and makes use of Sensirion’s innovative contaminationresistance technology. This technology, together with high-quality and long-lasting components, enables precise
measurements from its first operation and throughout its lifetime of more than ten years. In addition, Sensirion’s
advanced algorithms provide superior precision for different PM types and higher-resolution particle size
binning, opening up new possibilities for the detection of different sorts of environmental dust and other particles.
With dimensions of only 41 x 41 x 12 mm3, it is also the perfect solution for applications where size is of
paramount importance, such as wall-mounted or compact air quality devices.

Table 4 SPS30 pin assignment.

The SPS30 offers both a UART 7 and an I2C interface. For connection cables longer than 20 cm we recommend using
the UART interface, due to its intrinsic robustness against electromagnetic interference.
Note, that there is an internal electrical connection between GND pin (5) and metal shielding. Keep this metal shielding
electrically floating in order to avoid any unintended currents through this internal connection. If this is not an option,
proper external potential equalization between GND pin and any potential connected to the shielding is mandatory. Any
current though the connection between GND and metal shielding may damage the product and poses a safety risk
through overheating.

To minimize power consumption, the UART / I2C interface is also disabled.
A wake-up sequence is needed to turn the module back on. See Wake-up command in the interface description.

4.2 Fan Auto Cleaning
When the module is in Measurement-Mode an automatic fan-cleaning procedure will be triggered periodically following
a defined cleaning interval. This will accelerate the fan to maximum speed for 10 seconds in order to blow out the dust
accumulated inside the fan.

•
•
•
•
•

Measurement values are not updated while the fan-cleaning is running.
The default cleaning interval is set to 604’800 seconds (i.e., 168 hours or 1 week) with a tolerance of ±3%.
The interval can be configured using the Set Automatic Cleaning Interval command.
Set the interval to 0 to disable the automatic cleaning.
Once set, the interval is stored permanently in the non-volatile memory.
If the sensor is switched off, the time counter is reset to 0. Make sure to trigger a cleaning cycle at least every
week if the sensor is switched off and on periodically (e.g., once per day).
The cleaning procedure can also be started manually with the Start Cleaning command.

8 The typical particle size (TPS) gives an indication on the average particle diameter in the sample aerosol. Such output correlates with the weighted average of the

number concentration bins measured with a TSI 3330 optical particle sizer. Consequently, lighter aerosols will have smaller TPS values than heavier aerosols.

All “res.” bits are reserved for internal use or future versions. These bits can be both 0 and 1 and should therefore
be ignored.

Bit 21 SPEED: Fan speed out of range
0: Fan speed is ok.
1: Fan speed is too high or too low.
•

During the first 3 seconds after starting the measurement (fan start-up) the fan speed is not checked.

•

The fan speed is also not checked during the auto cleaning procedure.

•

Apart from the two exceptions mentioned above, the fan speed is checked once per second in the
measurement mode. If it is out of range twice in succession, the SPEED-bit is set.

•

At very high or low ambient temperatures, the fan may take longer to reach its target speed after start-up. In
this case, the bit will be set. As soon as the target speed is reached, this bit is cleared automatically.

•

If this bit is constantly set, this indicates a problem with the power supply or that the fan is no longer working
properly.

Bit 5 LASER: Laser failure
0: Laser current is ok.
1: Laser is switched on and current is out of range.
•

The laser current is checked once per second in the measurement mode. If it is out of range twice in
succession, the LASER-bit is set.

•

If the laser current is back within limits, this bit will be cleared automatically.

•

A laser failure can occur at very high temperatures outside of specifications or when the laser module is
defective.

Bit 4 FAN: Fan failure, fan is mechanically blocked or broken.
0: Fan works as expected.
1: Fan is switched on, but the measured fan speed is 0 RPM.
•

The fan is checked once per second in the measurement mode. If 0 RPM is measured twice in succession,
the FAN bit is set.

•

The FAN-bit will not be cleared automatically.

•

A fan failure can occur if the fan is mechanically blocked or broken.

5.2 SHDLC Frame Layer
On top of the UART interface, the SPS30 uses the very powerful and easy-to-implement SHDLC 10 protocol. It is a serial
communication protocol based on a master/slave architecture. The SPS30 acts as the slave device.
Data is transferred in logical units called frames. Every transfer is initiated by the master sending a MOSI 11 frame. The
slave will respond to the MOSI frame with a slave response, or MISO 12 frame. The two types of frames are shown in
Figure 4.

Start/Stop Byte and Byte-Stuffing
The 0x7E character is sent at the beginning and at the end of the frame to signalize frame start and stop. If this byte
(0x7E) occurs anywhere else in the frame, it must be replaced by two other bytes (byte-stuffing). This also applies to the
characters 0x7D, 0x11 and 0x13. Use Table 5 for byte-stuffing.

Example: Data to send = [0x43, 0x11, 0x7F]  Data transmitted = [0x43, 0x7D, 0x31, 0x7F].
Address
The slave device address is always 0.
Command
In the MOSI frame the command tells the device what to do with the transmitted data. In the MISO frame, the slave just
returns the received command.
Length
Length of the “TX Data” or “RX Data” field (before byte-stuffing).
State
The MISO frame contains a state byte, which allows the master to detect communication and execution errors.

The first bit (b7) indicates that at least one of the error flags is set in the Device Status Register.
The “Execution error code” signalizes all errors which occur while processing the frame or executing the command. The
following table shows the error codes which can be reported from the device. Note that some of these errors are system
internal errors which require additional knowledge to be understood. In case of a problem, they will help Sensirion to
localize and solve the issue.

Data
The data has a usable size of [0…255] bytes (original data, before byte-stuffing). The meaning of the data content
depends on the command.
Checksum
The checksum is built before byte-stuffing and checked after removing stuffed bytes from the frame. The checksum is
defined as follows:
1. Sum all bytes between start and stop (without start and stop bytes).
2. Take the least significant byte of the result and invert it. This will be the checksum.
For a MOSI frame use Address, Command, Length and Data to calculate the checksum.
For a MISO frame use Address, Command, State, Length and Data to calculate the checksum.
Example (MOSI frame without start/stop and without byte-stuffing):
Adr

5.3.5 Wake-up (CMD: 0x11)
Use this command to switch from Sleep-Mode to Idle-Mode. In Sleep-Mode the UART interface is disabled and must
first be activated by sending a low pulse on the RX pin. This pulse is generated by sending a single byte with the value
0xFF.
If then a Wake-up command follows within 100ms, the module will switch on again and is ready for further commands in
the Idle-Mode. If the low pulse is not followed by the Wake-up command, the microcontroller returns to Sleep-Mode after
100ms and the interface is deactivated again.
The Wake-up command can be sent directly after the 0xFF, without any delay. However, it is important that no other
value than 0xFF is used to generate the low pulse, otherwise it’s not guaranteed the UART interface synchronize
correctly.

MOSI Data: No data.
MISO Data: No data.

Alternatively, if the software implementation does not allow to send a single byte with the value 0xFF, the Wake-up
command can be sent twice in succession. In this case the first Wake-up command is ignored, but causes the interface
to be activated.

15 This command can only be executed in Idle-Mode.

• Clock stretching: not used

VDD
Rp

SDA

VDD (1)
SDA (2)

SCL

SPS30
Connector

SCL (3)
SEL (4)
GND (5)

Both SCL and SDA lines are open drain I/Os. They should
be connected to external pull-up resistors (e.g. Rp = 10 kΩ).
Important notice: in order to correctly select I2C as
interface, the interface select (SEL) pin must be pulled to
GND before or at the same time the sensor is powered up.

Figure 6: Typical I2C application circuit.

Some considerations should be made about the use of the I2C interface. I2C was originally designed to connect two chips
on a PCB. When the sensor is connected to the main PCB via a cable, particular attention must be paid to
electromagnetic interference and crosstalk. Use as short as possible (< 10 cm) and/or well shielded connection cables.
We recommend using the UART interface instead, whenever possible: it is more robust against electromagnetic
interference, especially with long connection cables.
For detailed information on the I2C protocol, refer to NXP I2C-bus specification 18.

6.2 Checksum Calculation
The Read and Write Commands transmit the data in 2-byte packets, followed by an 8-bit checksum. The checksum is
calculated as follows:
Property
Name
Protected Data
Width
Polynomial
Initialization
Reflect Input
Reflect Output
Final XOR
Example

Value
CRC-8
read and/or write data
8 bit
0x31 (x^8 + x^5 + x^4 + 1)
0xFF
false
false
0x00
CRC(0xBEEF) = 0x92

uint8_t CalcCrc(uint8_t data[2]) {
uint8_t crc = 0xFF;
for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
crc ^= data[i];
for(uint8_t bit = 8; bit > 0; --bit) {
if(crc & 0x80) {
crc = (crc << 1) ^ 0x31u;
} else {
crc = (crc << 1);
}
}
}
return crc;
}

Please note that the checksums are used only for the 2-byte data packets. The command code itself already contains a
3-bit CRC and therefore no checksum must be appended to it.
